# Steven Abdelshahid's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a **computer engineering student** with experience in C, Verilog, microcontroller programming, and circuit design. Below are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on and my skills.

## Projects

### 1. Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
A web-based tool for visualizing different sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and bubble sort. It includes features like reshuffling, a pause/play button, and algorithm switching during visualization.  
**Tech Used**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/StevenAbdelshahid/Sorting-Visualizer)

### 2. Dinorun in Verilog
A game built in Verilog that replicates the famous dinosaur running game.  
**Tech Used**: Verilog, FPGA

### 3. Toaster Oven Controller in C
A project using a finite state machine to control the operations of a toaster oven on a microcontroller. This project also involves graphical display on an OLED, event-driven programming, and interrupts.  
**Tech Used**: C, Microcontrollers, OLED Display

### 4. Password Manager App
A project for managing and storing passwords securely, focused on user authentication and encryption.  
Developed core functionality for adding, retrieving, and deleting passwords, with encrypted storage to ensure security.  
Incorporated features like password generation, search functionality, and password strength indicators to enhance usability.  
**Tech Used**: C, Encryption Libraries, File Handling

### 5. Multi-Threaded HTTP Server
Implemented a concurrent HTTP server using C and POSIX threads to handle multiple client requests efficiently.
- Developed a thread-safe server capable of handling up to `n` simultaneous client requests using a thread pool.
- Ensured atomic and coherent linearization of client requests via audit logs.
- Incorporated synchronization primitives like mutexes and condition variables to manage shared resources effectively.
- Produced an audit log to track request processing order and maintained memory efficiency by avoiding leaks.
- Designed the server to adhere to HTTP standards, supporting GET and PUT methods with dynamic resource handling.
**Tech Used**: C, POSIX Threads, Synchronization Primitives, Sockets
